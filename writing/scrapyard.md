delivery methodology
--------------------

Because Kanban focusses on always having a potentially releasable
product, it mitigates problems which could otherwise lead to
non-delivery and allows the direction to be changed while the project is
in progress. For each unit of work (under Kanban, a card), an entire
vertical slice of planning, design, implementation and reflection must
be complete before going onto the next card. Alongside each software
feature, every written chapter will be expanded and refactored in much
the same way as the code. Just as for well designed software, the order
of implementation should not be apparent to a user, my plan is that the
written work should not feel disjointed for having been written
non-sequentially. I plan to manage the Kanban process using paper only,
with cards on a physical board.
