<h1 id="abstract"><a href="#abstract"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Abstract</a></h1>
<p>A Javascript REST client library targeting both Node.js and web browsers that incorporates http streaming, pattern matching, and progressive JSON parsing, with the aim of improving performance, fault tolerance, and encouraging a greater degree of loose coupling between programs. Loose coupling is particularly considered in light of the application of Agile methodologies to SOA, providing a framework in which it is acceptable to partially restructure the JSON format in which a resource is expressed whilst maintaining compatibility with dependent systems.</p>
<p>A critique is made of current practice under which resources are entirely retrieved before items of interest are extracted programmatically. An alternative model is presented allowing the specification of items of interest using a declarative syntax similar to JSONPath. The identified items are then provided incrementally while the resource is still downloading.</p>
<p>In addition to a consideration of performance in absolute terms, the usability implications of an incremental model are also evaluated with regards to differences in user perception of performance.</p>
<h1 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This dissertation does not focus on implementing software for any particular problem domain. Rather, its purpose is to encourage the REST paradigm to be viewed through a novel lens. In application this may be used to deliver tangible benefits to many common REST use cases. Although I express my thesis through programming, the contribution I hope to deliver is felt more strongly as a shift in how we <em>think</em> about http than it is a change in the underlying technology.</p>
<p>In the interest of developer ergonomics, REST clients have tended to style the calling of remote resources similar to the call style of the host programming language. Depending on the language, one of two schemas are followed: a synchronous style in which the http call is an expression which evaluates to the resource that was fetched; or asynchronous or monadic in which some logic is specified which may be applied to the response once it is complete. This tendency to cast REST calls using terms from the language feels quite natural; we may call a remote service without having to make any adjustment for the fact that it is remote. However, we should remember that this construct is not the only possible mapping. Importing some moderate Whorfianism<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> from linguistics, we might venture to say that the programming languages we use encourage us to think in the terms that they easily support. For any multi-packet message sent via a network some parts will arrive before others, at least approximately in-order, but whilst coding a C-inspired language whose return statements yield single, discrete values it comfortable to conceptualise the REST response as a discrete event. Perhaps better suited to representing a progressively returned value would have been the relatively unsupported Generator routine<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In most practical cases where software is being used to perform a task there is no reasonable distinction between being earlier and being quicker. Therefore, if our interest is to create fast software we should be using data at the first possible opportunity. Examining data <em>while</em> it streams rather than hold unexamined until the message ends.</p>
<p>The coining of the term REST represented a shift in how we think about http, away from the transfer of hypertext documents to that of arbitrary data <sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>. It introduced no fundamentally new methods. Likewise, no genuinely new computer science techniques need be invented to realise my thesis. As a minimum, the implementation requires an http client which exposes the response whilst it is in progress and a parser which can start making sense of a response before it sees all of it. I also could not claim this thesis to be an entirely novel composition of such parts. Few ideas are genuinely new and it is often wiser to mine for solved problems then to solve again afresh. The intense competition of Web browsers to be as fast as possible has already found this solution. Load any graphics rich with images -- essentially an aggregation of hypertext and images -- the HTML is parsed incrementally while it is downloading and the images are requested as soon as individual &lt;img&gt; tags are encountered. The browser's implementation involves a highly optimised parser created for a single task, that of displaying web pages. The new contribution of this dissertation is to provide a generic analog applicable to any problem domain.</p>

<p>Figure  and Figure  illustrate how a progressive REST client, without adjustments being required to the server may be used to display some data requested by a user sooner. While the complete data should be available to the user significantly earlier, we see a much greater improvement in how early the first piece of data is able to be displayed. This is advantageous: firstly, even if the total time to show the data were not improved, progressive display improves the perception of performance [CITEME]; secondly, a user wanting to scan from top to bottom may start reading the first article while waiting for the later ones to arrive. Alternatively, seeing the first article alone may allow the user to notice earlier that they have requested the wrong author and allow them to backtrack earlier.</p>
<p>Although the label &quot;client software&quot; in the figures above hints at software running directly on a user's own device, nodes in an n-tier architecture can rarely be placed into client and server categories in a way which is appropriate from all frames of reference. Rather, it is common for nodes to be thought of as a client from the layer below and as a server from the layer above. The advantage demonstrated holds if the aggregation existing in this layer were actually running on a server to provide a higher-level REST service than the one that it aggregates. An progressive aggregator would perform the same function and see the same benefits but simply be pushed one layer back in the stack. The progressive view of http would allow progressive response to its http request, allowing the data to be viewed similarly progressively.</p>
<h2 id="stepping-outside-the-big-small-tradeoff"><a href="#stepping-outside-the-big-small-tradeoff"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Stepping outside the big-small tradeoff</a></h2>
<p>Where a domain model contains a series of data, of which ranges are made available via REST, I have often seen a trade-off with regards to how much of the series each call should request. Answering this question is usually a compromise between competing concerns in which it is not simultaneously possible to addresses all concerns satisfactorily. A good example might be a Twitter's pages listing a series of tweets where the interface designers adopted a currently trending pattern<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>, Infinite Scrolling. Starting from an initial page showing some finite number of tweets, upon scrolling to the bottom the next batch is automatically requested. The new batch is fetched in a json format and, once loaded, presented as html and added to the bottom of the page. Applied repeatedly this allows the user to scroll indefinitely, albeit punctuated by slightly jolting pauses while new content is loaded. To frame the big-small tradeoff we might consider the extreme choices. Firstly, requesting just one tweet per http request. By requesting the smallest possible content individual calls would complete very quickly and the pauses would be short. Taking the extreme small end the page stutters, pausing momentarily but frequently. Taking the opposite extreme, by requesting some huge number of tweets we see long periods of smooth scrolling partitioned by long waits.</p>
<p>I propose that my thesis may be applied used to stand down from this compromise by delivering pauses which are both infrequent and short. In the Twitter example, once we have thinking about http progressively this may be achieved quite simply by issuing large requests but instead of deferring all rendering until the request completes, render individual tweets incrementally as they are progressively parsed out of the ongoing response.</p>
<h2 id="staying-fast-on-a-fallible-network"><a href="#staying-fast-on-a-fallible-network"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Staying fast on a fallible network</a></h2>
<p>We have been extremely successful in building the TCP abstraction layer over many different networks with vastly different purposes, However this means that the reliability of networks that a REST client must work with varies greatly. At one extreme we have server-room sized networks delivering data over a span of few meters with a success rate for any particular http request-response that is so high as for failure to be negligible. Occupying the opposite extreme we have mobile networks in marginal signal where it is common for downloads to be abruptly terminated due to loss of connectivity.</p>
<p>Consider an everyday situation where a user is using a phone to check their email over a mobile network whilst travelling on a train. The user prefers the simplicity of webmail so the communications are sent via REST rather than a mail specific protocol such as POP3. In this scenario the signal can be expected to be lost and reestablished many times. Whilst not strictly forbidding it, none of the web developer's standard toolkit of AJAX libraries encourage a use of the partially downloaded response if the http request fails. For example, the popular AJAX library[CITE], jQuery, very helpfully parses complete JSON or XML responses before handing back to the application. But because incomplete messages are not valid markup, on connection failure jQuery does not attempt to parse the response. Because partial responses are only available to the programmer as raw text, to handle them would involve a special case and a different methodology. Because of this difficulty I can find no example other than such messages being dropped without inspection. In practice this means that for the user checking her email, even if 90% of her inbox had been downloaded she will be shown nothing. When the network is available again the application will have to download from scratch, including the 90% which it already fetched. In this regard REST falls short of the mail-specific protocols which would display messages one at a time as they are fetched. I see much potential for improvement here.</p>
<p>Whilst of course a REST client library cannot understand the semantics of specific messages fully enough to decide if a partially downloaded message is useful. I propose that it would be an improvement to provide callbacks in such a way that the calling application may make use of partially successful messages via much the same programming as for complete messages. This fits in very well with my vision of a http response as a progressive stream of many small parts. As each part arrives it should be possible to parse and pass onto the application without knowing if the whole will be delivered successfully.</p>
<p>This style of REST client encourages an attitude of optimistic locking in the application which uses it. Upon each partial delievery of the message there may be made an implicit assumption that the whole message will be successful and as such each part can be acted on straight away. On discovering a delivery failure the application should be notified in case it should wish to rollback some of those actions. The degree of rollback could vary greatly between application domains, in the example above of a webmail client it may be that no rollback at all is performed.</p>

<p>In many respects, a SOA architecture is a good fit for the fast release cycle encouraged by Agile methodologies. Because in SOA we may consider that all data is local rather than global and that the components of the system are loosely coupled, frequent releases of any particular sub-system shouldn't pose a problem to the correct operation of the whole. Under truly Agile practice, the formats of resources exposed via REST will emerge iteratively, mirroring the iterative design of the software which reifies the message.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in practice the tools used for REST fail to encourage programming in a loosely coupled way. Working in enterprise I have often seen the release of dozens of components cancelled because a single unit failed to meet acceptance criteria, even where the failing unit contained only minor changes. Because of a tight coupling which depends on exact versions, a dense dependency graph between inter-dependent units creates the perfect environment for contagion to occur whereby the impact from a single failing unit spreads until it infects all of the system.</p>
<p>As I see it, an effective way to solve this problem would be to integrate into a REST client library the ability to use a response whilst being only loosely coupled to the <em>shape</em> of the overall message. This should be without any additional effort by the programmer as compared using message but depending on a rigidly specified overall structure. Rather than having this means of interpreting a message as an optional extra, because I believe it to be beneficial that all messages are handled this way, it should be the default means of operation for this library.</p>
<h2 id="deliverables"><a href="#deliverables"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Deliverables</a></h2>
<p>To avoid feature creep I am paring down the software deliverables to the smallest area which delivers the greatest benefit. Amongst commentators on start-up culture this is known as a <em>zoom-in pivot</em> <sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup> and the work it produces should be the <em>Minimum Viable Product</em> or MVP[CITE], the guiding principle being that it is better to deliver a little well than more badly. By focusing tightly I cannot not deliver a full stack so I am forced to implement only solutions which interoperate in with existing stacks. This is advantageous; to somebody looking to improve an existing system, evolution is much easier to action than revolution and are therefore much more attractive.</p>
<p>To reify the vision above, a streaming client is the MVP. As we have already considered, all network transmissions are viewable though a streaming lens so an explicitly streaming server is not required. Additionally, whilst http servers capable of streaming are quite common, even if they are not typically programmed as such, I have been unable to find any example of a streaming-capable rest client.</p>
<h2 id="criteria-for-success"><a href="#criteria-for-success"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Criteria for success</a></h2>
<p>Whilst the primary area of concern for this dissertation is to improve the throughput and reactivity of systems created using REST, the approach chosen may also be considered against a secondary problem often experienced in REST systems: that of tight coupling between systems and the difficulty this brings in adding new semantics to existing message formats. I find that in many cases these problems exist solely as inflexible REST client software which is unprepared to accept slight or moderate variations on previously agreed formats. Whilst loose coupling isn't the primary concern of this dissertation, I have found it to be a significant problem area and any benefit my new approach can bring to this problem should be counted towards the success of the project.</p>
<p>In evaluating this project, we may say it has been a success if non-trivial improvements in speed can be made without a corresponding increase in the difficulty of programming the client. This improvement may be in terms of a measure of the absolute time required to complete a representative task or in a user's perception of the speed in completing the task. Because applications in the target domain are much more io-bound than CPU-bound, optimisation in terms of the running time of a program on the CPU will be de-emphasised unless especially egregious. Because the improvements I am seeking are due to a more efficient use of io rather than a more optimal algorithmic expression, no distinction is made between doing something earlier and doing it faster. Indeed, for the sake of this dissertation, earlier <em>is</em> faster.</p>
<p>Because REST is often communicated over unreliable connections, my client should also allow the use of partially delivered messages without requiring programming which treats this as a special case.</p>
<p>Finally, I shall be looking at common ways in which the semantics of a message may be added to as a system is developed and examining the degree to which it is easier to program in a way which handles these unanticipated changes under my client as compared to the current common practice.</p>

<p>In fact, this is exactly how web browsers are implemented. However, this progressive use of http is hardwired into the browser engines rather than exposing an API suitable for general use and as such is treated as something of a special case specific to web browsers and has not so far seen a more general application. I wish to argue that a general application of this technique is viable and offers a worthwhile improvement over current common methods.</p>
<p>The above problem has many analogues and because REST uses standard web semantics applies to much more than just automated web surfing. Indeed, as the machine readability of the data increases, access early can be all the more beneficial since decisions to terminate the connection may be made. Example: academic's list of publications, then downloading all the new ones.</p>

<p>First stage after getting a resource is usually to programmatically extract the interesting part from it. This is usually done via calls in the programming language itself, for example by de-marshaling the stream to domain objects and then calling a series of getters to narrow down to the interesting parts.</p>
<p>This part has become such a natural component of a workflow that it is barely noticed that it is happening. In an OO language, the extraction of small parts of a model which, in the scope of the current concern are of interest is so universal that it could be considered the sole reason that getters exist.</p>
<p>However subtly incorporated it has become in the thinking of the programmer, we should note that this is a construct and only one possible way of thinking regarding identifying the areas of current interest in a wider model.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode java"><code class="sourceCode java"><span class="co">// an example programmatic approach to a domain model interrogation under Java</span>

List&lt;Person&gt; people = myModel.<span class="fu">getPeople</span>();
String firstPersonsSurname = people.<span class="fu">get</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>).<span class="fu">getSurname</span>();</code></pre>
<p>One weakness of this imperative, programatic inspection model is that, once much code is written to interogate models in this way, the interface of the model becomes increasingly expensive to change as the code making the inspections becomes more tightly coupled with the thing that it is inspecting. Taking the above example, if the model were later refactored such that the concepts of firstName and surName were pulled from the Person class into an extracted Name class, because the inspection relies on a sequence of calls made directly into domain objects, the code making the query would also have to change.</p>
<p>I believe that this coupling defies Agile methods of programming. Many Java IDEs provide tools that would offer to automate the above extraction into a Name class, creating the new class and altering the existing calls. While reducing the pain, if we accept the concept as I stated in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a> that the code should not be seen as a static thing in which understanding is</p>
<p>More declarative syntaxes exist which are flexible enough that the declarative expressions may still apply as the underlying model is refactored. Whilst not applicable to use in general purpose programming, XPATH is an example of this. As an analogue of the Java situation above, Given the following XML:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;people&gt;</span>
   <span class="kw">&lt;person&gt;</span>
      <span class="kw">&lt;surname&gt;</span>Bond<span class="kw">&lt;/surname&gt;</span>
   <span class="kw">&lt;/person&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/people&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>The XPath //person[0]//surname//text() (JIM/ME - CHECK THIS!) would continue to identify the correct part of the resource without being updated after the xml analogue of the above Java Name refactor:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;people&gt;</span>
   <span class="kw">&lt;person&gt;</span>
      <span class="kw">&lt;name&gt;</span>
         <span class="kw">&lt;surname&gt;</span>Bond<span class="kw">&lt;/surname&gt;</span>
      <span class="kw">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
   <span class="kw">&lt;/person&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/people&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>A few models exist which do not follow this pattern such as XPATH. However, these are useful in only a small domain.</p>
<p>Xpath is able to express identifiers which often survive refactoring because XML represents a tree, hence we can consider relationships between entities to be that of contains/contained in (also siblings?). In application of XML, in the languages that we build on top of XML, it is very natural to consider all elements to belong to their ancestors. Examples are myriad, for example consider a word count in a book written in DOCBook format - it should be calculable without knowing if the book is split into chapters or not since this is a concept internal to the oranisation of the book itserlf nd not soemthing that a querier is likely to find interesting - if this must be considered the structure acts as barrier to information rather than enabling the information's delivery. Therefore, in many cases the exact location of a piece of information is not as important as a more general location of x being in some way under y.</p>
<p>This may not always hold. A slightly contrived example might be if we were representing a model of partial knowledge:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;people&gt;</span>
   <span class="kw">&lt;person&gt;</span>
      <span class="kw">&lt;name&gt;</span>
         <span class="kw">&lt;isNot&gt;&lt;surname&gt;</span>Bond<span class="kw">&lt;/surname&gt;&lt;/isNot&gt;</span>

   <span class="kw">&lt;/person&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/people&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>CSS. Meant for presentation of HTML, but where HTML markup is semantic it is a selector of the <em>meaning of elements</em> for the sake of applying a meaningful presentation more so than a selector of arbitrary colours and positions on a screen.</p>

<p>Javascript: not the greatest for 'final' elegant presentation of programming. Does allow 'messy' first drafts which can be refactored into beautiful code. Ie, can write stateful and refactor in small steps towards being stateless. An awareness of beautiful languages lets us know the right direction to go in. An ugly language lets us find something easy to write that works to get us started. Allows a very sketchy program to be written, little more than a programming scratchpad.</p>
<p>Without strict typing, hard to know if program is correct without running it. In theory (decidability) and in practice (often find errors through running and finding errors thrown). Echo FPR: once compiling, good typing tends to give a reasonable sureness that the code is correct.</p>
<p>Explain var/function difference, ie construct pluck and explain why var keyOf = partial(pluck) is declared with a var and not a function, why some prefer to do always via . operator can't be made into a function with (.) or similar and so has to be wrapped in a function is a less direct manner. Unfortunately, can make it difficult for a reader to know the types involved. For example, on seeing: <code>var matchesJsonPath = jsonPathCompiler( pattern )</code> there is no way (other than examining the source or doucmentation of the function being called) to know that this is a higher order function and will return another function to be assigned as matchesJsonPath.</p>
<p>C-style brackets around all function arguments hampers a natural expression of functional style code. For example, this requires a lot of arguments and without checking of function airity, it is easy to misplace a comma or closing bracket.</p>
<pre><code>function map(fn, list){
   if( !list ) {
      return emptyList;
   } else {
      return cons(fn(head(list)), map(fn,tail(list)));

<blockquote>
<p>node Stream API, which is the core I/O abstraction in Node.js (which is a tool for I/O) is essentially an abstract in/out interface that can handle any protocol/stream that also happens to be written in JavaScript. [http://maxogden.com/a-proposal-for-streaming-xhr.html]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bash streams a powerful abstraction easily programmed for linear streaming. Node more powerful, allows a powerful streaming abstraction which is no more complex to program than a javascript webapp front end. Essentially a low-level interface to streaming such as unix sockets or tcp connections.</p>
<p>Streams in node are the observer pattern. Readable streams emit 'readable' events when they have some data to be read and 'end' events when they are finished. Apart from error handling, so far as reading is concerned, that is the extent of the API.</p>
<p>Although the streams themselves are stateful, because they are based on callbacks it is entirely possible to use them from a component of a javascript program which is wholly stateless.</p>
<p>Using Node's http module provides a stream but handles setting headers, putting the method otu etc.</p>
<p>What Node is V8. Fast. Near-native. JIT.</p>
<p>V8 is often said to be 'near-native' speed, meaning it runs at close to the speed of a similarly coded C program. However, this relies on the programmer also coding in the style of a C programmer, for example with only mono-morphic callsites and without a functional style. Once either of those programming techniques is taken up performance drops rapidly [http://rfrn.org/~shu/2013/03/20/two-reasons-functional-style-is-slow-in-spidermonkey.html]. When used in a functional style, not 'near-native' in the sense that not close to the performance gained by compiling a well designed functional language to natively executable code. Depends on style coded in, comparison to native somewhat takes C as the description of the operation of an idealised CPU rather than an abstract machine capable of executing on an actual CPU.</p>
<p><em>Anecdote: SVG engine: one function for xy vs x and xy. Very large speed increase. Add figures etc.</em></p>
<p>Why Node perhaps is mis-placed in its current usage as a purely web platform &quot;the aim is absolutely fast io&quot;. This happened because web specialist programmers took it up first</p>

<p>Because of the contagion problem, need to be able to create loosely-coupled systems.</p>
<p>Inside systems also, even with automatic refactoring tools, only automate and therefoer lessen but do not remove the problem that coupling causes changes in one place of a codebase to cause knock-on changes in remote other parts of the code. A method of programming which was truly compatible with extreme programming would involve designing for constant change without disparate parts having to be modified as structural refactoring occurs.</p>
<p>I propose that in a changing system, readability of code's changelog is as important as readability of the code itself. Extraneous changes dilute the changelog, making it less easily defined by code changes which are intrinsically linked to the actual change in the logic being expressed by the program.</p>
<p>It is often stated that understandability is the number once most important concern in a codebase (CITE) - if the code is suitably dynamic it is important that changes are axiomic and clarity of the changelog is equally important.</p>

<p>A feature set which is minimal but contain no obvious omissions.</p>
<p>Under the heading <a href="#anatomy-of-a-soa-client">Anatomy of a SOA client</a> I deconstructed the way in which programming logic is often used to identify the parts of a model which are currently interesting and started to look at some declarative ways in which these parts can be obtained.</p>
<p>Turn this model inside out. Instead of the programmer finding the parts they want as a part of the general logic of the program, declaratively define the interesting parts and have these parts delivered to the language logic. Once we make the shift to thinking in this way, it is no longer necessary to have the whole resource locally before the interesting sub-parts are delivered.</p>
<p>Focus on replacing ajax, rather than streaming. In older browsers, getting the whole message at once is no worse than it is now.</p>

<p>Because Kanban focusses on always having a potentially releasable product, it mitigates problems which could otherwise lead to non-delivery and allows the direction to be changed while the project is in progress. For each unit of work (under Kanban, a card), an entire vertical slice of planning, design, implementation and reflection must be complete before going onto the next card. Alongside each software feature, every written chapter will be expanded and refactored in much the same way as the code. Just as for well designed software, the order of implementation should not be apparent to a user, my plan is that the written work should not feel disjointed for having been written non-sequentially. I plan to manage the Kanban process using paper only, with cards on a physical board.</p>

<p>In which a callback call is received not just when the whole resource is downloaded but for every interesting part which is seen while the transfer is ongoing. The definition of 'interesting' will be generic and accommodating enough so as to apply to any data domain and allow any granularity of interest, from large object to individual datums. With just a few lines of programming</p>
<p>Best of both modes</p>
<p>Granularity: only need read as far as necessary. Services could be designed to write the big picture first. Alternatively, where resources link to one another, can stop reading at the link. Eg, looking for a person's publications, start with an index of people but no need to read whole list of people.</p>

<li>Special token for root, takes advantage of object identity to make certain that cannot clash with something from the json. Better than '<strong>root</strong>' or similar which could clash.

<p>Like SAX, calls from clarinet are entirely 'context free'. Ie, am told that there is a new object but without the preceding calls the root object is indistinguishable from a deeply nested object.

<p>NB: This consideration of type in json could be in the Background section.</p>
<p>Xml comes with a strong concept of the <em>type</em> of an element, the tag name is taken as a more immediate fundamental property of the thing than the attributes. For example, in automatic json-Java object demarshallers, the tag name is always mapped to the Java class. In JSON, other than the base types common to most languages (array, object, string etc) there is no further concept of type. If we wish to build a further understanding of the type of the objects then the realtionship with the parent object, expressed by the attribute name, is more likely to indicate the type. A second approach is to use duck typing in which the relationship of the object to its ancestors is not examined but the properties of the object are used instead to communicate an enhanced concept of type. For example, we might say that any object with an isbn and a title is a book.</p>
<p>Duck typing is of course a much looser concept than an XML document's tag names and collisions are possible where objects co-incidentally share property names. In practice however, I find the looseness a strength more often than a weakness. Under a tag-based marshalling from an OO language, sub-types are assigned a new tag name and as a consumer of the document, the 'isa' relationship between a 'class' tagname and it's 'sub-tabname' may be difficult to track. It is likely that if I'm unaware of this, I'm not interested in the extended capabilities of the subclass and would rather just continue to recieve the base superclass capabilities as before. Under duck typing this is easy - becase the data consumer lists the</p>
<p>A third injection of type into json comes in the form of taking the first property of an object as being the tagname. Unsatisfactory, objects have an order while serialised as json but once deserialised typically have no further order. Clarinet.js seems to follow this pattern, notifying of new objects only once the first property's key is known so that it may be used to infer type. Can't be used with a general-purpose JSON writer tool, nor any JSON writer tool that reads from common objects.</p>
<p>Design not just for now, design to be stable over future iterations of the software. Agile etc.</p>
<p>Why an existing jsonPath implmentation couldn't be used: need to add new features and need to be able to check against a path expressed as a stack of nodes.</p>
<p>More important to efficiently detect or efficiently compile the patterns?</p>
<p>The failure of sax: requires programmer to do a lot of work to identify interesting things. Eg, to find tag address inside tag person with a given name, have to recognise three things while reieving a callback for every single element and attribute in the document. As a principle, the programmer should only have to handle the cases which are interesting to them, not wade manually through a haystack in search of a needle, which means the library should provide an expressive way of associating the nodes of interest with their targetted callbacks.</p>
<p>First way to identify an interesting thing is by its location in the document. In the absense of node typing beyond the categorisation as objects, arrays and various primative types, the key immediately mapping to the object is often taken as a lose concept of the type of the object. Quite fortunately, rather than because of a well considered object design, this tends to play well with automatically marshaling of domain objects expressed in a Java-style OO language because there is a stong tendency for field names -- and by extension, 'get' methods -- to be named after the <em>type</em> of the field, the name of the type also serving as a rough summary of the relationship between two objects. See figure  below.</p>

<li>Take stateful code</li>

<p>How do notifications fit into this?</p>
<p>By going to List-style, enforced that functions fail when not able to give an answer. Js default is to return the special 'undefined' value.

<p>The code presented is the result of the development many prior versions, it has never been rewritten in the sense of starting again. Nontheless, every part has been complely renewed several times. I am reviewing only the final version. Git promotes regular commits, there have been more than 500.</p>
<p>some of it is pure functional (jsonPath, controller) ie, only semantically different from a Haskell programme others, syntactically functional but stateful to fit in with expected APIs etc</p>
<p>JsonPath implementation allows the compilation of complex expressions into an executable form, but each part implementing the executable form is locally simple. By using recursion, assembling the simple functions into a more function expressing a more complex rule also follows as being locally simple but gaining a usefully sophisticated behaviour through composition of simple parts. Each recursive call of the parser identifies one token for non-empty input and then recursively digests the rest.</p>
<p>The style of implementation of the generator of functions corresponding to json path expressions is reminiscent of a traditional parser generator, although rather than generating source, functions are dynamically composed. Reflecting on this, parser gens only went to source to break out of the ability to compose the expressive power of the language itself from inside the language itself. With a functional approach, assembly from very small pieces gives a similar level of expressivity as writing the logic out as source code.</p>
<p>Why could implement Function#partial via prototype. Why not going to. Is a shame. However, are using prototype for minimal set of polyfills. Not general purpose.</p>

<p>Partial completion is implemented using the language itself, not provided by the language.</p>
<p>Why would we choose 1 over the other? First simpler from caller side, second more flexible. Intuitive to call as a single call and can call self more easily.</p>
<p>In same cases, first form makes it easier to communicate that the completion comes in two parts, for example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"> <span class="fu">namedNodeExpr</span>(previousExpr, capturing, name, pathStack, nodeStack, stackIndex )</code></pre>
<p>There is a construction part (first 3 args) and a usage part (last three). Comsume many can only be constructed to ues consume 1 in second style because may refer to its own paritally completed version.</p>
<p>In first case, can avoid this: <code>consume1( partialComplete(consumeMany, previousExpr, undefined, undefined), undefined, undefined, pathStack, nodeStack, stackIndex);</code> because function factory can have optional arguments so don't have to give all of them</p>
<p>Function factory easier to debug. 'Step in' works. With partialCompletion have an awkward proxy function that breaks the programmer's train of thought as stepping through the code.</p>
<p>Why it is important to consider the frame of mind of the coder (CITEME: Hackers and Painters) and not just the elegance of the possible language expressions.</p>
<p>If implementing own functional caching, functional cache allows two levels of caching. Problematic though, for example no way to clear out the cache if memory becomes scarce.</p>
<p>Functional programming tends to lend better to minification than OO-style because of untyped record objects (can have any keys).</p>
<p>Lack of consistency in coding (don't write too much, leave to the conclusion)</p>
<p>Final consideration of coding: packaging up each unit to export a minimal interface. * Why minimal interfaces are better for minification</p>
<h2 id="the-mutability-problem"><a href="#the-mutability-problem"><span class="header-section-number">4.12</span> The mutability problem</a></h2>
<p>Javascript provides no way to decalre an object with 'cohorts' who are allowed to change it whereas others cannot - vars may be hidden via use of scope and closures (CITE: crockford) but attributes are either mutable or immutable.</p>
<p>Why this is a problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>bugs likely to be attributied to oboe because they'll be in a future <em>frame of execution</em>. But user error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>full functional-style immutability. Don't change the objects, just have a function that returns a new one with one extra property. Problem - language not optimised for this. A lot of copying. Still doesn't stop callback receiver from changing the state of hte object given. (CITE: optimisations other languages use)</li>
<li>immutable wrappers.</li>
<li>defensive cloning</li>
<li>defining getter properties</li>

<h2 id="functions-over-constructors"><a href="#functions-over-constructors"><span class="header-section-number">4.14</span> functions over constructors</a></h2>
<p>What constructors are in js. Any function, but usually an uppercase initial char indicates that it is intended to be used as a constructor.</p>
<p>Inheritence is constructed using the language itself. While this is more flexible and allows each project to define a bespoke version of inherience to suit their particular needs or preferences, it also hampers portability more than an 'extends' keyword would.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far, the JavaScript community has not agreed on a common inheritance library (which would help tooling and code portability) and it is doubtful that that will ever happen. That means, we’re stuck with constructors under ECMAScript 5. http://www.2ality.com/2013/07/defending-constructors.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Functions can be like Factories, gives me the flexability to chagne how something is created but by exposing a constructor are stuck with using 'new' to create an instance of exactly one type.</p>
<p>Dart has 'factory' constructors which are called like constructors but act like factory functions: (http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html#ch02-constructor-factory)</p>

<p>http://www.jimmycuadra.com/posts/ecmascript-5-array-methods Unlike the new methods discussed in the first two parts, the methods here are all reproducible using JavaScript itself. Native implementations are simply faster and more convenient. Having a uniform API for these operations also promotes their usage, making code clearer when shared between developers.</p>
<p>Even when only used once, preferable to polyfill as a generic solution rather than offer a one-time implementation because it better splits the intention of the logic being presented from the mechanisms that that logic sits on and, by providing abstraction, elucidates the code.</p>

</div>
<p>How automated testing improves what can be written, not just making what is written more reliable.</p>
<p>TDD drives development by influencing the design - good design is taken as that which is amenable to testing rather than which describes the problem domain accurately or solves a problem with minimum resources. Amenable to testing often means split into many co-operating parts so that each part may be tested via a simple test.</p>
<p>Bt encourageing splitting into co-operating objects, TDD to a certain degree is anti-encapsulation. The public object that was extracted as a new concern from a larger object now needs public methods whereas before nothing was exposed.</p>

<img src="images/pyramid.png" alt="The testing pyramid is a common concept, relying on the assumption that verification of small parts provides a solid base from which to compose system-level behaviours.

<p>Jstd can serve example files but need to write out slowly which it has no concept of. Customistation is via configuration rather than by plug-in, but even if it were, the threading model is not suitable to create this kind of timed output.</p>
<p>Tests include an extremely large file twentyThousandRecords.js to test under stress</p>
<p>Why jstd's built in proxy isn't sufficient. An example of a typical Java webserver, features thread-based mutlithreading in which threads wait for a while response to be received.</p>
<p>Tests deal with the problem of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; - when a program is made out of parts whose correct behaviour cannot be observed without all of the program. Allows smaller units to be verified before verifying the whole.</p>
<p>Conversely, automated testing allows us to write incomprehensible code by making us into more powerful programmers, it is possible building up layers of complexity one very small part at a time that we couldn't write in a simple stage. Clarity &gt; cleverness but cleverness has its place as well (intriducing new concepts)</p>
<p>Testing via node to give something to test against - slowserver. Proxy. JSTD not up to task. Shows how useful node is as a 'network glue'. The same as C was once described as a 'thin glue' [http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch04s03.html]. Transparent proxy is about 20 lines. Transparent enough to fool JSTD into thinking it is connecting directly to its server.</p>
<p>Node comes with very little built in (not even http) but relies on libraries written in the language itself to do everything. Could implement own http on top of sockets if wanted rather than using the provided one.</p>
<p>The test pyramid concept  fits in well with the hiding that is provided. Under the testing pyramid only very high level behaviours are tested as ??? tests. While this is a lucky co-incidence, it is also an unavoidable restriction. Once compiled into a single source file, the individual components are hidden, callable only from withing their closure. Hence, it would not be possible to test the composed parts individually post-concatenation into a single javascript file, not even via a workarround for data hiding such as found in Java's reflection. Whereas in Java the protection is a means of protecting otherwise addressable resources, once a function is trapped inside a javascript closure without external exposure it is not just protected but, appearing in no namespaces, inherently unreferenceable.</p>
<p>TDD fits well into an object pattern because the software is well composed into separate parts. The objects are almost tangible in their distinction as separate encapsulated entities. However, the multi-paradigm style of my implementation draws much fainter borders over the implementation's landscape.</p>
<p>Approach has been to the test the intricate code, then for wiring don't have tests to check that things are plumbed together correctly, rather rely on this being obvious enough to be detected via a smoke test.</p>
<p>A good test should be able to go unchanged as the source under test is refactored. Indeed, the test will be how we know that the code under test still works as intended. Experince tells me that testing that A listens to B (ie that the controller wires the jsonbuilder up to clarinet) produces the kind of test that 'follows the code arround' meaning that because it is testing implementation details rather than behaviours, whenever the implementation is updated the tests have to be updated too.</p>
<p>By testing individual tokens are correct and the use of those tokens as a wider expression, am testing the same thing twice. Arguably, redundant effort. But may simply be easier to write in that way - software is written by a human in a certain order and if we take a bottom-up approach to some of that design, each layer is easier to create if we first know the layers that it sits on are sound. Writing complex regular expressions is still programming and it is more difficult to test them completely when wrapped in rather a lot more logic than directly. For example, a regex which matches &quot;{a,b}&quot; or &quot;{a}&quot; but not &quot;{a,}&quot; is not trivial.</p>
<p>Can test less exhaustively on higher levels if lower ones are well tested, testing where it is easier to do whilst giving good guarantees.</p>
<p>Genuine data hiding gets in the way sometimes. Eg, token regexes are built from the combination of smaller regualar expressions for clarity (long regular expressions are concise but hard to read), and then wrapped in functions (why? - explain to generify interface) before being exposed. Because the components are hidden in a scope, they are not addressable by the tests and therefore cannot be directly tested. Reluctantly</p>
<p>One dilemma in implementing the testing is how far to test the more generic sections of the codebase as generic components. A purist approach to TDD would say</p>
<p>Could implement a resume function for if transmission stops halfway</p>
<pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">   .<span class="fu">onError</span>( error ) {
      <span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="fu">resume</span>();
   }</code></pre>

<p>Aim of creating a micro-library rules out building in a general-purpose IoC library.</p>

<p>Why the Observer pattern (cite: des patterns) lends itself well to MVC and inversion of control.</p>
<p>What the central controller does; acts as a plumber connecting the various parts up. Since oboe is predominantly event/stream based, once wired up little intervention is needed from the controller. Ie, A knows how to listen for ??? events but is unintested who fired them.</p>

<p>Same pattern could be extended to XML. Or any tree-based format. Text is easier but no reason why not binary applications.</p>
<p>Not particularly useful reading from local files.</p>
<p>Does not save memory over DOM parsing since the same DOM tree is built. May slightly increase memory usage by utilising memory earlier that would otherwise be dept dormant until the whole transmission is received but worst case more often a concern than mean.</p>
<p>Implementation in a purely functional language with lazy evaluation: could it mean that only the necessary parts are computed? Could I have implemented the same in javascript?</p>
<p>Would be nice to: * discard patterns that can't match any further parts of the tree * discard branches of the tree that can't match any patterns * just over the parsing of branches of the tree that provably can't match any of the patterns</p>
