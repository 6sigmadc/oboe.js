Delivery methodology
--------------------

My thesis will be developed 'in the open' by committing all code and
writing to a public repository hosted on Github. This should allow
members of the developer community to contribute comments and
suggestions as the work progresses. I plan to use Kanban to deliver my
dissertation, including the written parts. Because Kanban focusses on
always having a potentially releasable product, it mitigates problems
which could otherwise lead to non-delivery and allows the direction to
be changed as necessary. For each unit of work (under Kanban, a card),
an entire vertical slice of planning, design, implementation and
reflection must be complete before going onto the next card. Alongside
each software feature, every written chapter will be expanded and
refactored in much the same way as the code. Just as for well designed
software, the order of implementation should not be apparent to a user,
my plan is that the written work should not feel disjointed for having
been written non-sequentially. I plan to manage the Kanban process using
paper only, with cards on a physical board.

Timescales
I am registered on the Software Engineering Program until December. While requesting an extension to my time on the course might be sensible to cover unforeseen circumstances, I plan to deliver the dissertation towards the end of 2012.
Summary of deliverables
I propose to create a Javascript BDD-style assertion framework which borrows heavily from functional programming, particularly QuickCheck. Research and analysis of source code ergonomics should result in a framework enabling tests that are easily understandable, maintainable and readable as plain English. The tests will be runnable in all reasonable contexts using existing test runners. To demonstrate correctness, the testing framework will be capable of testing itself.
