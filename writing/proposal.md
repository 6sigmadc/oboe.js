Behaviour Driven Development
----------------------------

Behaviour Driven Development, or BDD, is today one of the standard
methods for developing software, particularly under agile methodologies.
Using BDD, every required behaviour of the system should have a
corresponding test to demonstrate that this requirement has been met.
Alongside their use in as demonstrating that the intended behaviours are
met, the tests often serve as the sole documentation for the correct
behaviour of a system's units.

Application of my dissertation
------------------------------

Client-side web scripting via Javascript is a field which at inception
contributed no more than small, frequently gimmicky, dynamic features
added to otherwise static webpages. Today the scope and power of client
side scripting has increased to the extent that the entire interface for
large, complex applications is often programmed in this way. These
applications are not limited to running under traditional web browsers
but also include mobile apps and desktop software. Given the very fast
expansion the web has seen from a technology based around marked-up
documents to a full-blown application suite, it is not surprising that
the tools have lagged behind in comparison to more mature languages.
While TDD and BDD have been common for a long time, Javascript has only
recently started to benefit from this more rigorous approach. I believe
this lateness is not due to problems inherent with the language;
Javascript is very amenable to automated testing. I propose creating BDD
assertions for Javascript that are the equal of the best available in
any language. Particularly of interest at the moment is QuickCheck,
which I plan to draw some inspiration from.

The existing Javascript BDD technology stack
--------------------------------------------

Test runners exist which allow a developer to push tests to several
platforms simultaneously, returning results within milliseconds. Of the
numerous runners, a Google project, JS Test Driver, JSTD, is emerging as
the deÂ facto standard. JSTD comes with a deliberately basic set of
assertions. However, tests written using these assertions are more of a
unit-testing form than a behavioural testing style and are not easily
maintainable by non-programmers. The JSTD web site states that their
assertion functions are rudimentary because they would rather focus on
creating the client-server aspects of their application. The JSTD
project hopes that better assertions will be contributed by the open
source community. So far, developers providing BDD frameworks for
Javascript have mostly attempted to deliver full-stack applications
rather than concentrating on just one part. This approach frequently
overreaches and fails to take advantage of a considerable body of prior
work, manifesting itself as a rather defuse effort which tackles many
areas but excels at none. I propose to focus relatively narrowly,
creating only a framework for assertions and for maximum compatibility
to do so in a way that is agnostic as to the context in which the
assertions are used.

Programming language influences and considerations
--------------------------------------------------

Delivering a BDD framework involves writing software which is used in
modelling the desired behaviour of software. Because it is code applied
to code, the model of a testing framework exists at a higher level of
abstraction than developers typically engage. Hence, the design
considerations will be quite different from programming a model of the
typical application domain. In order to allow a natural expression of
bdd-style tests in Javascript, I propose that I will first create a
functional programming library on which it will depend. This will
require a large degree of metaprogramming. This library will reproduce
as closely as possible the necessary features from languages such as
Haskell. Although the code under test will almost certainly come with
side effects, the assertions should allow tests that are themselves free
of side-effects and wholly stateless.

Source code ergonomics and BDD as documentation
-----------------------------------------------

With Behavioural tests functioning as documentation, it is desirable
that the tests be understandable not just by software developers but
also individuals with little understanding of programming. This
understandability by non-experts will be gained by providing a framework
which allows tests that, as well as functioning as running software, may
be expressed in a form very close to grammatically correct English. The
ability to program tests in plain English will be a concern throughout
my dissertation. For every story delivered, I will be considering
developer ergonomics and iteratively developing a thesis of the factors
which contribute to a highly usable testing framework.

Self-verification
-----------------

My BDD framework will itself be developed under the advantages that
BDD-style testing brings. With this in mind, the framework will be used
to test itself. Because it becomes quite 'meta', testing a BDD framework
is a relatively difficult problem domain to apply BDD to. Hence, if my
framework is flexible enough to be used in this way I will judge it
suitable for application to most problem domains. As well as ensuring
that the framework is capable, self-verification allows me to write the
BDD assertion framework while myself using BDD, enabling safe
refactoring of existing code.

Delivery methodology
--------------------

My thesis will be developed 'in the open' by committing all code and
writing to a public repository hosted on Github. This should allow
members of the developer community to contribute comments and
suggestions as the work progresses. I plan to use Kanban to deliver my
dissertation, including the written parts. Because Kanban focusses on
always having a potentially releasable product, it mitigates problems
which could otherwise lead to non-delivery and allows the direction to
be changed as necessary. For each unit of work (under Kanban, a card),
an entire vertical slice of planning, design, implementation and
reflection must be complete before going onto the next card. Alongside
each software feature, every written chapter will be expanded and
refactored in much the same way as the code. Just as for well designed
software, the order of implementation should not be apparent to a user,
my plan is that the written work should not feel disjointed for having
been written non-sequentially. I plan to manage the Kanban process using
paper only, with cards on a physical board.

Timescales
----------

I am registered on the Software Engineering Program until December.
While requesting an extension to my time on the course might be sensible
to cover unforeseen circumstances, I plan to deliver the dissertation
towards the end of 2012.

Summary of deliverables
-----------------------

I propose to create a Javascript BDD-style assertion framework which
borrows heavily from functional programming, particularly QuickCheck.
Research and analysis of source code ergonomics should result in a
framework enabling tests that are easily understandable, maintainable
and readable as plain English. The tests will be runnable in all
reasonable contexts using existing test runners. To demonstrate
correctness, the testing framework will be capable of testing itself.
