Oboe.js is being presented as an academic dissertation. This directory contains my main ramblings.

None of the files in here (other than this one) are Github-flavoured markdown. The tool you need is
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

It shouldn't be treated as a general purpose manual. If you need to learn Oboe, see the main project README,
if that doesn't help mail me or raise a ticket.
