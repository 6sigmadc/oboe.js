Oboe.js is being presented as my MSc dissertation to complete my degree at the University of Oxford.
This directory contains my many ramblings, currently very incomplete and sketchy.

None of the files in here (other than this one) are Github-flavoured markdown. The tool you need is
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). There's a fairly good chance Github will display them correctly
but it won't understand everything.

This shouldn't be treated as a general purpose manual. If you need to learn Oboe, see the main project README,
if that doesn't help mail me :-)
